onnections:
Hardware:
1)connect the circuit diagram as shown in the circuit below
2)First inorder to establish communication we should understand the the way of communication
between the devices as shown in below figure
3)In general for to devices to communicate the tx of device1 should be connected to rx of device2 and
vice versa.
4)But for dumping the code into the devices the connections should be tx->tx&rx->rx.
5)For this purpose,initially the tx of arduino is connected tx of esp and rx-of arduino to rx of esp.
6)This connection will allow us to dump code into esp from pc bypassing the arduino
7)To,bypass arduino either there should be no code present in it or press the reset button of arduino
as long as the uploading starts untill you see done uploading message on the screen.
8)To make sure that there is no code present in arduino
Open arduinoide->goto file->examples->basics->bareminimum->select board as
arduinouno/genuino->upload it.
9)selection of board can be done by
Goto Tools->board->arduino/genuino

Configuring software:
1)first we have to install the esp8266 board in arduino ide.
2)For this purpose,go to file->preferences and in additional boards manager column paste the
following url and press ok.
url:http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.com
3)Now goto tools->boards->boards manger->search for esp8266->click install.
4)For dumping the code into esp8266 module the board should be set to generic esp8266 in arduino

Coding:

Communication:
1)here I used software serial to communicate between arduino and esp.
2)The rx of s/w serial should be connected to tx of esp and tx of s/w serial should be connected to rx
of esp.
3)Communication between esp and pc(serial monitor) is possible only when arduino is in Reset
condition.so, if we use serial.print command we cannot print it on serial monitor.
4)For this method,the only way is to transmit the message that we want print to arduino and let the
arduino print the message on serial monitor for esp.
